Have you ever thought about what it might be like to relive the best moments of your life, and be able to share them with others?
<br />
Maybe it’s the dance floor at your wedding. Or the birth of your child or his or her first birthday. Maybe it’s that touchdown that led your team to victory in the last seconds of a game.
