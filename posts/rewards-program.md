(NewsUSA) – The COVID-19 pandemic and historically low mortgage interest rates have caused a flurry of home buying across the United States. Families are searching for more flexible work or learning spaces, larger homes and spacious yards for cooped up kids.
<br />
For those just getting started, an Arizona-based real estate rewards and referral network company, RBN (Real Buyer Network), offers homebuyers added value to their purchase through its relationship with American Express.
<br />
Here’s how it works: Homebuyers use an RBN participating agent for their home purchase and they can earn American Express Membership Rewards® points up to the purchase price of the home.Larry and Myra of North Carolina recently earned more than 500,000 reward points with RBN. "We enrolled with RBN and were put in touch with Thomas Wohl, Broker, Realtor and it’s probably the best decision we ever made. Thomas was not just interested in us buying a house, but rather we bought the RIGHT house for us." The home purchase itself follows the traditional real estate process of cash or mortgage financing.Founder Kipp Lassetter says, before prospective homebuyers get started, before touring any homes, before interviewing any other agents or doing anything in the home buying process, they need to visit RBN’s site.
<br />
"Choose from the most qualified participating agents, buy their home through the traditional real estate process and earn rewards. Using an RBN participating agent is a no-brainer."Lassetter was inspired to found RBN after his own home buying experience, in which he struggled to find a real estate agent with expertise in local neighborhoods and a willingness to go the extra mile on service and support.
<br />
RBN fills this niche by partnering with the best local agents and rewarding homebuyers for selecting these agents. "Each participating agent endures a rigorous vetting process that includes a one-on-one interview and review of sales performance," Lassetter says. Home purchasers have already earned millions of rewards points using RBN participating real estate agents. If you don’t have an existing American Express account, don’t worry. The RBN virtual wallet tracks and maintains your points until you connect to an eligible account.Visit joinrbn.com for more information and to connect with an RBN participating real estate agent in your area.
